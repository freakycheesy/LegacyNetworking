# LegacyNetworking

another [REDACTED] networking library 🫩<br>
(built on top of [Riptide](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide) by [Riptide Networking](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking))

Meant to replace Unity's [ABANDONED Legacy RakNet](https://docs.unity3d.com/540/Documentation/Manual/NetworkReferenceGuide.html) 🥀💔<br>
or an alternative of [Photon PUN](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) (pun is literally just like legacy raknet lmao) 🤭

## What makes this different then other solutions (Mirror, FishNet, NGO, Fusion)

It's free, it doesn't use a weaver, and it's simple like it should be!

## What can you do (should be would lol)

Use NetworkView for your networked gameobjects, IObservable for syncing data, RPCs to send functions remotely over the network!<br>
Spawn NetworkView Prefabs and Load Levels!
